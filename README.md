Welcome to my IMDb Movie Analysis project — a deep dive into the world of cinema from 2006 to 2016. In this exploratory data analysis (EDA) journey, I’ve uncovered trends, visualized insights, and highlighted the brightest stars and genres of the silver screen 🌟.

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle - IMDb Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and includes information such as:
- Movie Title
- Release Year
- Genre
- IMDb Rating
- Duration
- Director
- Cast (Stars)
- Number of Votes (if available)

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

- ✨ Cleaned and transformed dataset
- 📊 Visually rich charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- 🎭 Genre analysis, rating distributions, and yearly trends
- 👥 Top actors & directors by frequency and rating
- 🧠 Smart filtering (e.g. actors with 3+ movies)
- 🎨 Beautiful headings and storytelling in the Jupyter notebook

> **📁 To add these images:**  
> Create a folder in your repo named `sample-images` and upload your charts as `.png` images with matching names.  
> Use `plt.savefig("sample-images/top_movies.png")` before `plt.show()` to export them directly from Colab!
